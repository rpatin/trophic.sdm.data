# Introduction

# News

## v.0.0.1 - First Release (21/02/2023)

### Release feature

- workflow for trophic dataset based on gbif data
- detection of taxonomic conflicts within trophic groups with
  `detect_taxonomic_conflict()`. i.e.Â predator with some prey within the
  same trophic groups but with very different taxonomy (that would be
  problematic to mix in a trophic sdm)
- detection of gbif observation outside of IUCN ranges and diagnostic of
  the distance to IUCN distribution.
- calculation of gbif sampling effort
- buffer calculation for IUCN polygon ranges

### Missing features

- no support for filtering atlas data & multiple resolutions
- no workflow for IUCN
- no evaluations
- no subsampling
- no calculation of aggregated prey metrics
- no splitting of trophic group in metaweb
