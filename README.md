# Introduction

# News

Pre-Release Features (v. 0.0.1) - detection of taxonomic conflicts
within trophic groups with `detect_taxonomic_conflict()`. i.e.Â predator
with some prey within the same trophic groups but with very different
taxonomy (that would be problematic to mix in a trophic sdm) - detection
of gbif observation outside of IUCN ranges and diagnostic of the
distance to IUCN distribution. - calculation of gbif sampling effort -
rasterization and buffer calculation for IUCN polygon ranges
